# 42 C Projects Collection

Welcome to my repository, where I showcase my journey through **42 School's C programming projects**. This collection includes a variety of projects, each designed to enhance programming fundamentals and mastery of the C language.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following projects:

### 1. **[Libft](./Libft)**
   - **Description**: A custom implementation of essential C library functions, built from scratch.
   - **Status**: üöÄ Completed
   - **Purpose**: To understand and implement low-level string and memory management functions.

### 2. **[Ft_printf](./printf)**
   - **Description**: A personalized `printf` function, replicating its behavior in standard libraries.
   - **Status**: üõ†Ô∏è In Progress
   - **Purpose**: To explore variadic functions, formatting, and buffer management.

### 3. **[Get Next Line](./gnl)**
   - **Description**: A function to read one line at a time from a file descriptor.
